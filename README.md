# Simple Bulletin
A very simple bulletin board build as a sample application featuring zurb foundation, mongoose, TingoDB via tungus, express, scss, bower, compass, and moment.js. 

This application is by no means meant to be used productively but might be the foundation for a production site. Because mongoose is used, TingoDB can be easily swaped out with MongoDB.
